Title: Simple Sufficient Conditions for Weak Reciprocal Upper Semi-Continuity in Extended Games
Abstract: We provide a sufficient condition for a game with discontinuous payoffs to be weakly reciprocally upper semi-continuous in mixed strategies. This condition is imposed on the individual payoffs and not on their sum, and it can be readily verified in a large class of games even when the sum of payoffs in such games is not upper semi-continuous. We apply our result to establish the existence of mixed strategy equilibria in probabilistic voting competitions when candidates have heterogenous beliefs about the distribution of the voters.
