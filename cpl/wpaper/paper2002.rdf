Title: Sweating the energy bill: Extreme weather, poor households, and the energy spending gap
Abstract: We find energy spending disparities that indicate extreme weather causes hardship for low-income households. Using the 2004-2018 U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey, we estimate the relationship between temperature and energy spending separately for low-income and all other households. Both groups respond similarly -- in percentage terms -- to moderate temperatures, but low-income households' energy spending is half as responsive to extreme temperatures. We find similar disparities in the food spending response to extreme temperature, consistent with a credit constraints mechanism. These results suggest adaptation to extreme weather, such as air conditioning use, is prohibitively costly for low-income households.
