Title: The Effects of Recreational Cannabis Access on the Labor Market: Evidence from Colorado
Abstract: Recreational access to cannabis may have a positive effect on labor demand due to investments in growing, processing and retail cannabis facilities, and spillovers to interconnected industries such as manufacturing, and leisure and hospitality. Using county-level Colorado data from 2011-2018 and exploiting the variation in the timing of commencement of sale of dispensaries, we test for changes in the unemployment rate, employment and wages, overall as well as in manufacturing, construction, and services. Consistent with an increase in labor demand, we estimate that the sale of recreational cannabis through dispensaries is associated with a 0.7 percentage point decrease in the unemployment rate with no effect on total labor force participation. We also find a 4.5 percent increase in the overall number of employees, with effects concentrated in manufacturing and services. We do not find an effect on average weekly wages overall or by sector. Given the lack of a reduction in labor force participation or wages, negative effects on labor supply are likely limited, in line with the existing literature. The decrease in the unemployment rate, coupled with an increase in the number of employees, indicates that labor demand effects are likely to dominate. Our results suggest that policymakers considering recreational access to cannabis should account for increased employment as a possible outcome.
