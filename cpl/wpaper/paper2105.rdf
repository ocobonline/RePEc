Title: Is the Price Right? Returns to Input Adoption in Uganda 
Abstract: We estimate the profitability of fertilizer and hybrid seed use in Uganda, inputs widely promoted to enhance smallholder farmersâ€™ productivity, but that have low rates of adoption. Past studies that evaluate the returns to agronomic inputs generally assume a fixed output price and do not account for the high output price volatility that farmers face. Using unique historical output price data, we show that adoption of fertilizer is more profitable than hybrid seed, and that price volatility alone cannot explain the low levels of adoption. When we consider input quality and poor weather conditions returns can become negative even at median prices. Risk aversion further exacerbates low adoption in some markets.
