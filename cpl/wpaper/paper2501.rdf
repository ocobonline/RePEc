Title: Tenure Density Calibrated and Recalibrated
Abstract:  Tenure density (TD) denotes the ratio between tenure-track (TT) faculty and all faculty. We examine whether universities should equalize TD across units. We bring  tools fromWelfare Economics into the analysis and consider utilitarian, egalitarian, and arbitrator universities. We show that utilitarians assign larger TD to larger units in terms of students, while the opposite is true for egalitarians and arbitrators. Faculty costs influence decisions for utilitarians and arbitrators but not egalitarians. None of
these university objectives lead to the TDR. Only inequality-averse universities might apply TDR under specific conditions. The TDR therefore does not appear to be a universally optimal method for university resource allocation.
