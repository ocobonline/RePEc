Title: Scoring Benefits to Eastward Travel in the NBA 
Abstract: Travel across time zones may affect player scoring through their circadian rhythm. We test how team travel affects team scoring for the US National Basketball Association from 2014-2018, a period that coincides with the start of a new game scheduler. Next, we test whether a collective bargaining agreement with schedule restrictions protecting player rest changed the relationship between travel and scoring statistics. We find eastward travel increases scoring via three-pointers and field goals. The 2017 collective bargaining agreement mitigates the eastward travel benefit on scoring and increases scoring overall, suggesting improved fairness and potential benefits for players and fans.
