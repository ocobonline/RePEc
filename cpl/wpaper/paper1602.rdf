Title: The Path to College Education: Are Verbal Skills More Important than Math Skills?
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study the differential roles of math and verbal skills for educational outcomes. By estimating a multi-period factor model of skills, using a rich panel database that follows all students in England from elementary school to university, we find that verbal skills play a greater role in explaining university nrollment than math skills. In addition, we use our framework to study the timing of skill development during compulsory schooling. Results show that 40% of skills measured at the end of compulsory education are developed between the ages of 7 and 16, which indicates some scope for overcoming initial skill disadvantages. Finally, we study the gender gaps in college enrollment and STEM field enrollment, showing that verbal skills and comparative advantage in skills are key determinants of these gaps.
